## 9 January 2022
Added and filled out migrations, routes, uncommented rack-cors. We'll be doing this with a react front end, because why not (even though the other MacCready is pure Ruby. I'm whimsical.)
Modified order of operations whoops.
Pushed to save current structure
Added Active Model Serializers gem
Commented out the tzinfo gem because it was annoying the crap outta me
Added basic models for existing migrations
**MIGRATIONS NOT YET RUN**
Pushed again
Added basic outline of controllers
Added URL field to entries migration (this is why we don't run migrations immediately, hah)
Pushed again. The rest of this will have to wait when I'm not sick and running a fever and probably making SOCC errors. (Sub-Optimal Coding Conditions)
