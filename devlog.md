Created GitHub repository, pushed first commit

## 9 January 2022
Added and filled out migrations, routes, uncommented rack-cors. We'll be doing this with a react front end, because why not (even though the other MacCready is pure Ruby. I'm whimsical.)
Modified order of operations whoops.
Pushed to save current structure
Added Active Model Serializers gem
Commented out the tzinfo gem because it was annoying the crap outta me
Added basic models for existing migrations
**MIGRATIONS NOT YET RUN**
Pushed again
Added basic outline of controllers
Added URL field to entries migration (this is why we don't run migrations immediately, hah)
Pushed again. The rest of this will have to wait when I'm not sick and running a fever and probably making SOCC errors. (Sub-Optimal Coding Conditions)

Entered preliminary code into User and Portfolio controllers
Need to decide if this is going to be JS front end or Ruby front end. Right now it's a JS front end
**MIGRATIONS NOT YET RUN**

Okay, we'll make this a JS front end. But only JS, no framework. So far.
Entered preliminary code into Entry controller
Keep in mind a lot of the controller code is going to have to be rejiggered to suit the JS front end
**MIGRATIONS NOT YET RUN**
**RUN MIGRATIONS ON NEXT PASS**
